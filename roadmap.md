# Roadmap
- [x] Decide on hosting
    - Currently neocities
    - This can be revisited once the group is officially recognized and more resources are available to us
        - Possible [hosting or at least sa.utoronto.ca link redirection](https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/service/web-space-for-recognized-campus-clubs-and-groups/) for recognized groups
        - Should be careful not to break backlinks if we migrate
- Website
    - Ideally it should be designed as the primary form of communication for the club (see [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE))
    - [x] Basics: club intro, contact, roadmap, web directory, README and learning resource collections
    - [x] RSS feed updates (via Github Actions triggered rebuilds)
    - Webring?
- Marketing
    - [ ] Logo
    - Posters
    - Social Media
        - Fediverse?
        - [ ] Instagram
