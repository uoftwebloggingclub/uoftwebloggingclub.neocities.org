The overall mission of the Introverts Club is to provide introverted students with a space to socialize, share their experiences, and learn how to make the most out of their time at the University of Toronto Mississauga (UTM). To achieve this mission, the club will regularly host general meetings, speaker events, skills workshops, and support groups and facilitate campaigns that spread awareness about on-campus mental health services and engagement opportunities. Creating a warm and welcoming environment is paramount to our success as all members should feel wanted, no matter their year of study, POSt, background, or comfort level with socialization.
