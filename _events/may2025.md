This abstract theme encourages you to consider the cyclical nature (or not) of all things, from the cycle of life to your morning rituals. Though you are not required to answer all or any of these, the following list of questions can help you get started:

- What is your daily routine?
- Which season is your favourite?
- Do you believe in reincarnation?
- Does history repeat itself?
- What songs do you play on repeat?
