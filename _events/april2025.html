<h2>This month's theme: Nostalgia</h2>
<p>April, as the start of spring, is a month of reflection and new beginnings. As you look back at the past from the present, write a blog post on the feeling of nostalgia. Though you are not required to answer all or any of these, the following list of questions can help you get started:</p>
<ul>
    <li>What triggers your nostalgia?</li>
    <li>Describe a childhood memory…</li>
    <li>What is a movie or TV show that you’re nostalgic for?</li>
    <li>Is nostalgia a negative or positive emotion?</li>
    <li>Does nostalgia distort the past?</li>
</ul>
