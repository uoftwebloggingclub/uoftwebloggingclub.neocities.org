<p>Welcome to the {{ site.title }}'s homepage.</p>
<p>We are a club that fosters the creation and sharing of blogs and homebrew websites. If you are still learning the basics, you can develop your programming skills and creativity in a supportive envoriment. If you already have a website, you can have discussions with and draw inspiration from likeminded people (and get more eyes on your efforts).</p>
<p>If you are new to the club, check out our <a href="/readme">README</a></p>
