To add a seasonal style,
1. Compute the starting timestamp and assign it to a variable called event_ts
2. Add an additional clause in the final if statement checking if the event is currently active
3. Create a new html file in _includes for your styling
4. Include it in the clause you created in step 3
5. Optionally, you can also give your event a sitewide variable to modify things outside of your include (for example, a simple message on the homepage)
Do not try comparing integer timestamps with each other, for some reason Jekyll cannot handle large numbers. Covert them to/leave them as strings.
