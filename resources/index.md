## RSS

The most important feature of your site if you want consistent readers! RSS allows a program called an *RSS Reader* to automatically check for updates without going through the effort of visiting individual sites! Its also used in our syndication pipeline (for example, the [Recent Feeds section](/) on the main page). 

-  [A Gentle Intro to RSS](https://derekkedziora.com/blog/rss-guide) - some motivation for RSS vs regular recommendation algorithms

- [An Intro to RSS Feeds](https://meganesulli.com/blog/how-rss-works/) - a guide on how RSS readers and aggregation actually works

- [RSS Cheatsheet](/resources/rsscheatsheet) - a cheatsheet for getting RSS feeds from certain services that don't advertise them
