For the case of e-zines, there is also the fact that distribution is though the internet, allowing for a more interesting collaboration dynamic. In some cases, this collaboration is pseudonymous, so artists might not even know each other by name!</p>\n\n<p>I’ve decided to archive a few of these because of the ethereal nature of these projects, with websites going down and file uploads getting removed, and the occasional nuke-everything-and-run by the admins. Many of these zines are uploaded in the most bizarre places, such as <a href=\"https://itch.io\">itch.io</a> and <a href=\"https://mega.io/\">Mega</a>, which makes it impossible for the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/\">Wayback Machine</a> to properly archive.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"archival\">Archival</h3>\n\n<p>The archive is currently around 2GB on my hard drive which might cause issues with Github if I upload it all directly to my website. I’ll try to reduce the size somehow and make a page available later containing all the issues for each of these zines.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lainzine\">Lainzine</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://farazkaleemmalik.cyou/assets/images/ezines/lainszine.png\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://lainzine.org/\">Website</a></p>\n\n<p>This was my first exposure to e-zines. Topics include cyberpunk/hacker culture, but there a lot of variety even within this specific space. There’s a lot of intro-level articles on a variety of computer science and math topics, some creative/political writing, and a suspicious amount of drug procurement guides. I also think these stylistically hit out of the park: I especially love the covers and full-page intermediary pieces.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"black-fog\">Black Fog</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://farazkaleemmalik.cyou/assets/images/ezines/blackfog.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blackfogzine.org/\">Website</a></p>\n\n<p>This one is more focused on art (with a vague internet/glitch theme), with issues consisting of concatenated comics and visual art collections, from photography to glitch art to drawings. I particularly love the style here too.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"cyberbully\">cyberbully</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://farazkaleemmalik.cyou/assets/images/ezines/cyberbully.png\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cyberbullyzine.itch.io/\">Website</a></p>\n\n<p>This e-zine has a focus on internet users, but of course gravitates to the smallweb since <em>that’s where all the all the fun happens obviously</em>. Lots of fun pages, and I especially love the ASCII art full pages and cover.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"paged-out\">Paged Out</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://farazkaleemmalik.cyou/assets/images/ezines/pagedout.png\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pagedout.institute/\">Website</a></p>\n\n<p>This one is a more technical-oriented zine a la <a href=\"https://phrack.org/\">Phrack</a>, but not just raw ASCII which makes the whole thing a lot more readable (though more expensive archive). I particularly like the “ICO/PDF polyglot guide” from Issue 1 since this knowledge has somehow come up in a job interview. Theres tons of fun esoteric things like quines and code golfing, even if you aren’t into cybersecurity, though its a bit inaccessible if you aren’t familiar with low level programming.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"poc-or-gtfo\">PoC or GTFO</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://farazkaleemmalik.cyou/assets/images/ezines/pocorgtfo.png\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/angea/pocorgtfo\">Mirror</a></p>\n\n<p>This zine is typeset in LaTeX which tells a lot about the style of articles inside. Similar to Paged Out, there’s a lot of writeup-style explorations in very deep technical domains. As the name suggests, expanded as “Proof of Concept or Get the Fuck Out”, the articles aren’t abstract in the least: they are things you are able to do <em>now</em> on existing computers and setups (which is different from the more abstract kinds of info you learn from textbooks and courses).</p>"},{"title":"WHWC Monthly Theme #1: Selected bookmarks","link":"https://sonechka.neocities.org/blog/bookmarks","description":"in response to this month's theme for WHWC, I wanted to link some sites I like that I think are relevantly niche.","date":"2025-03-13 17:55:00 UTC","host":"sonechka.neocities.org","content":""},{"title":"Oscars 2025: Forced to see Sean Baker happy","link":"https://sonechka.neocities.org/blog/oscars","description":"first blog post","date":"2025-03-03 14:00:00 UTC","host":"sonechka.neocities.org","content":""},{"title":"One new review","link":"https://sonechka.neocities.org/books","description":"Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia","date":"2025-02-25 12:40:00 UTC","host":"sonechka.neocities.org","content":""},{"title":"BroncoCTF 2025 QR Coded Writeup","link":"https://farazkaleemmalik.cyou/blog/2025/bronco/","description":"This writeup was requested multiple times on Discord so here it is.

Of course, these variations are impossible to notice on the final image.</p>\n\n<p>One thing to notice is that the colourful superposition actually forms a valid, <em>but different</em> QR code.

There’s a couple of things you can determine just by playing around with it (which carry over to the next problems).</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>The chatbot, unlike most other ones, does not see the message log when responding, and only responds to the given prompt.

How I imagine this works is that the application feeds a secret prompt (with the flag contents and additional instructions on handling user input) to a generic LLM, with the user’s prompt appended at the end, similar to how <a href=\"https://c.ai\">‘flavored’</a> chatbots work.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://farazkaleemmalik.cyou/assets/images/iss2025llm/doyouknowtheflag.png\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p>Lets start probing it for the flag then.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"strategy-1-asking-nicely\">Strategy 1: Asking nicely</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://farazkaleemmalik.cyou/assets/images/iss2025llm/askingnicely.png\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p>The chatbot is nice enough to tell us the exact condition for which it is allowed reveal the flag.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"strategy-2-pretending-to-be-an-admin\">Strategy 2: Pretending to be an admin</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://farazkaleemmalik.cyou/assets/images/iss2025llm/imadmin.png\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p>Great!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"level-2-authoritarian\">Level 2: Authoritarian</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"strategy-1-asking-nicely-again\">Strategy 1: Asking nicely (again)</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://farazkaleemmalik.cyou/assets/images/iss2025llm/unauthorized.png\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p>I’m… unauthorized?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://farazkaleemmalik.cyou/assets/images/iss2025llm/authenticate.png\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p>So it appears I need some kind of credentials to authenticate.

Let give it a bit of encouragement…</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://farazkaleemmalik.cyou/assets/images/iss2025llm/system-message.png\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p>It seems to <em>sometimes</em> think that I’m authorized, but has trouble giving exactly what I want. Let’s be more explicit about that. After a handful of tries…</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://farazkaleemmalik.cyou/assets/images/iss2025llm/success2.png\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p>A slight modification I made was to refer to the flag as a ‘string’ to loosen the influence of its instructions, which no doubt state that it can’t reveal the <em>flag</em>. I’m honestly not sure if it helps.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"level-3-janus\">Level 3: Janus</h2>\n\n<p>This is the final level of the category.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"strategy-1-ask-nicely-again-again\">Strategy 1: Ask nicely (again again)</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://farazkaleemmalik.cyou/assets/images/iss2025llm/janus-nicely.png\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p>One thing to note about this response was that it’s <em>near instant</em>, unlike all other generated responses so far. To demonstrate:</p>\n\n<video width=\"800\" controls=\"\">\n  <source src=\"https://farazkaleemmalik.cyou/assets/videos/iss2025llm/janus.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"/>\n</video>\n\n<p>This indicates that it isn’t the LLM responding, but rather some other simpler system that processes the prompt <em>before</em> it, giving us a prewritten response if triggered. My first guess was a trivial wordfilter. Let’s test that theory.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://farazkaleemmalik.cyou/assets/images/iss2025llm/apple.png\" alt=\"\"/>\n<em>No apples :(</em></p>\n\n<p>It seems ‘flag’ is one of the the trigger words. Some others:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://farazkaleemmalik.cyou/assets/images/iss2025llm/wordfilter.png\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p>While a wordfilter for prompts is a challenge, theres also a possibility that the LLM’s <em>output</em> is also wordfiltered, which is a much greater challenge assuming the <em>actual flag contents</em> are cleverly included. In that case, I would need the LLM to accurately transform the data using a method more intricate than the filtering rules (at one point I was trying to get it to reverse its output)</p>\n\n<p>I also noticed some strange behaviour when responding to some of the weirder prompts, in which case the LLM would hallucinate chat logs.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://farazkaleemmalik.cyou/assets/images/iss2025llm/hallucination.png\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p>This gave me an idea for an attack. The LLM isn’t fed chatlogs <em>from the application</em>, but we can totally feed it fake ones that we made up, putting words in its (metaphorical) mouth. It reminds me of one of <a href=\"https://worldofwork.io/2019/07/cialdinis-6-principles-of-persuasion/\">Cialdini’s principles of persuasion</a>, consistency, where people are more likely to do something if it conforms with their previous actions. Who knew LLMs fell for the same tricks?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://farazkaleemmalik.cyou/assets/images/iss2025llm/janus.png\" alt=\"\"/>\n<em>This is the actual screenshot of when I solved it</em></p>\n\n<p>This response may have also bypassed any ‘flag filter’ just by escaping the underscores as a bonus. Everything else was just light encoragement for it to give me the <em>actual flag</em>. Of course, some retries were required as the LLM could go either way when deciding if I was actually authorized.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h1>\n\n<p>Fun challenge and fun CTF overall!</p>"},{"title":"The Seaweed Is Always Greener In Somebody Else's Lake","link":"https://www.cruciverbology.com/post/the-seaweed-is-always-greener-in-somebody-else-s-lake","description":"Not a spoiler.

I actually use it for CalDAV as well, all in all its a featureful organisation software.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest flaw for me is the fact that settings cannot be synced between clients. So for example, since Thunderbird is on my desktop, when I add a feed to my reader on it, it doesn’t show up on the Thunderbird on my laptop. Furthermore, what if I want to read on my phone? Do I need to maiantain 3 lists of the same thing manually?</p>\n\n<p>One solution is a web based one. That is, your RSS feed sits on a server somewhere and you run a web application that lets you access it from anywhere with an internet connection and browser. In most cases however, this would require such a person to learn system administration, which while valuable knowledge serves as a significant barrier to entry. One could use someone else’s instance, but in my search I found it really difficult to find anyone else offering this.</p>\n\n<p>My solution was somewhat born out of an idea: what if we could apply Thunderbird’s mail filters to RSS feed entries? I’m not really sure what I expected to happen, but apparently it was actually possible! Thunderbird seems to treat your entire “Blogs and News Feeds” section as one mail folder, and treats each incoming feed entry as an incoming email. Neat!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-solution\">The solution</h2>\n\n<p>We can use mail filters to move RSS entries as they come in to a specific subfolder in your mailbox.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What? Can articles and blogposts really be uploaded to a mailbox?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thunderbird appears to store feed entries as emails, or somehow converts entries to emails (with metadata becoming email headers) during handling of our rules. It strangely works, though you may see some missing info if you view it from another client like K9 Mail. Here are the rules. Recall that the message filter window can be opened by clicking the top-left hamburger menu then going to Tools -&gt; Message Filters.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"on-blogs-and-feeds\">On ‘Blogs and Feeds’</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://farazkaleemmalik.cyou/assets/images/thunderbird/rules1.png\" alt=\"First set of rules\"/></p>\n\n<p>Some email addresses are redacted for privacy, but really it should be the email address you want to upload the feed entries to. It first tags them as RSS, then moves them to your inbox.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But why not move it to your ‘RSS’ subfolder directly?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We also want to mark all entries in our email copies of the feed items as read, while maintaining the ‘unreadness’ in our main reader. It would be annoying having to mark 2 entries as read every time you read an article, so we don’t bother</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"on-email-inbox\">On Email Inbox</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://farazkaleemmalik.cyou/assets/images/thunderbird/rules2.png\" alt=\"Second set of rules\"/></p>\n\n<p>Once an RSS tagged entry is detected, it marks the entry as ‘Read’ then moves it to the corresponding folder, without messing with any of the original feed entries. Neat! If you open this folder on another Thunderbird client, most of the metadata you are used to seeing like the “Website” tag is still there surprisingly, allowing you to read your feeds anywhere you choose.</p>"},{"title":"Getting started with OpenPGP on Thunderbird 115.13.0","link":"https://farazkaleemmalik.cyou/blog/2024/thunderbird1/","description":"2 posts in a row!

I can’t believe it!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"overview\">Overview</h2>\n\n<p>For some reason, Thunderbird decides to change key workflows every few months that make any previous instruction on the matter completely pointless and even convoluting the entire process. I’m aware even this guide will be outdated within months but I’ll make one anyways just because. The version of Thunderbird I am using is the latest for Linux Mint 21.3 as of the date posted.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"step-0\">Step 0</h3>\n\n<p>You first need to have some email account imported into Thunderbird. There are tons of articles exaplining this and its otherwise quite intuitive, so I’ll skip it.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"step-1-open-openpgp-menu\">Step 1: Open OpenPGP Menu</h3>\n\n<p>You first need to generate your PGP keys. This is assuming you don’t already have PGP keys associated with your account. Remember, this is a getting started guide, in which case you would have to import them using a similar but not covered process.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://farazkaleemmalik.cyou/assets/images/thunderbird/menu1.png\" alt=\"Tools\"/></p>\n\n<p>Open the hamburger menu in the top right corner of the application, and then go Tools</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://farazkaleemmalik.cyou/assets/images/thunderbird/menu2.png\" alt=\"OpenPGP Key Manager\"/></p>\n\n<p>Then select “OpenPGP Key Manager”. This should open up a new menu (which I won’t show since it’s populated with some personal contacts).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"step-2-generate-keys\">Step 2: Generate Keys</h3>\n\n<p>In the toolbar for the new menu, select “Generate -&gt; New Pair”. From there the defaults should be fine, just make sure that the “Identity” email address is the one you want. You will have to generate a new key for each email account you want to send encrypted email on.</p>\n\n<p>Once you are done, there will be an entry in your OpenPGP Key Manager window for the key you just created.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"step-3-set-key-to-active-encryption-key\">Step 3: Set key to active encryption key</h3>\n\n<p>Go to your accounts settings page. For me this is the gear on the bottom left corner of the window and then the option saying “Account Settings” still on the bottom left. Find the email address you just generated in the list on the left, and go to the entry saying “End-to-End Encryption” underneath it.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://farazkaleemmalik.cyou/assets/images/thunderbird/menu3.png\" alt=\"End-to-End\"/></p>\n\n<p>From there, like shown above, select the second option (the one with numbers) and you will see a checkmark, which means you’re done! You can publish your key by pressing the relevant button, but make sure you’re using a computer you actually <em>own</em> since the key is stored on your actual machine. Basically, if you’re at a library or on a school computer, you stop here and do this on a computer your own!</p>\n\n<p>That’s it so far. To actually <em>send</em> an email you would need to import someone else’s key from either a keyserver or a file, but I’ll leave that part for another time.</p>\n\n<p>For site maintenance, I’ve added an RSS feed and will add my own PGP key soon.</p>"},{"title":"Update on last 2 posts","link":"https://farazkaleemmalik.cyou/blog/2024/update1/","description":"A small update on the ongoing nature of my previous two posts","date":"2024-11-07 00:00:00 UTC","host":"farazkaleemmalik.cyou","content":"<p>A small update on the ongoing nature of my previous two posts</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"update-to-the-homelab\">Update to the homelab</h2>\n\n<p>Fun fact: old gear breaks! Especially when you open it to do upgrades! This is what happened to my Netgear NAS as soon as I opened it to replace the probably decades-old fan with a silent Noctua. Disassembly required many different parts to be disconnected and unscrewed, so its anyone’s guess where the issue lies. I did remove the socketed RAM extraneously because I was interested about the specs, but at this point buying new RAM just to see if that’s the issue would be falling victim to the sunken-cost fallacy.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, I went to this nice <a href=\"https://computation.ca/\">computer refurbisher on Jane street</a> and bought an old Elitedesk to operate as both my storage and server (sorry Sesame Snaps server, you will be remembered in all your sweetness). It’s been going stable for over 6 months, a very capable machine indeed. This is my second machine I have bought from this shop, the first being the desktop I am writing this article on.</p>\n\n<p>For further updates, I’ve LAN-ed up most of my network to get proper gigabit connections between all my machines, though the WAN is still restricted by my 100/10M Linksys router. I guess I know what part of my network I need to upgrade next.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"update-to-lineageos\">Update to LineageOS</h2>\n\n<p>That project is basically dead. I used whatever flashing setup I had to just flash a stock Android ROM I got off the internet for my specific device. I’ve decided to stop fighting against my phone manufacturer for control over my phone and decided to just choose my hardware a bit more carefully next time. For all of its flaws, the Pinephone actually seems like a decent option right now, given that it can do exactly what I need it to and nothing more. And the keyboard case? Chef’s kiss.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://farazkaleemmalik.cyou/assets/images/update/keyboard.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p>The concept of a cyberdeck is really growing on me, and this seems like the cheapest method to achieve a pocketable version that also supports portable connection methods like LTE and cellular calling. Its been thrust into the public zeitgeist again thanks to a Youtube trend just how insanely easy it is for phone networks to triangulate your location just by your phone being on, so I’m happy there is at least one device that allows your to physically disable your modem via a dip switch should you want to.</p>"},{"title":"Car-dinal Sins","link":"https://www.cruciverbology.com/post/car-dinal-sins","description":"Image source It's reading week, which means that I have some time on my hands, so I've made a new puzzle I'm very excited about!

I use Home\nManager with Nix flakes, and am quite happy, except for one very\nannoying aspect of it: since I use Home Manager as a NixOS module,\nanytime I make a change to a program’s configuration file, I need to\nrebuild the entire system in order for those changes to take effect.\nThis slows down many workflows that involve updating files in home\ndirectories (mainly program configurations).</p>\n<p>We’ll use the example of neovim. Home Manager takes my configuration\noptions (the options I set for neovim through the home manager module,\nand also the path to the raw lua/vim configuration files that I point\nto) and builds them into a full neovim configuration (setting the\ncorrect runtime paths, putting plugins in the right places, and so on).\nIt then puts that configuration in an entry in this nix store, and\nsymlinks it to the appropriate home directory\n(<code>~/.config/nvim</code> in the case of neovim). All of this does\ngive us the benefits of nix, i.e reproducibility, and having our neovim\nconfiguration in the same place as the rest of our system, neatly\norganized inside the flake.</p>\n<p>The problem is that home manager is part of my system’s NixOS\nconfiguration. Let’s take a look at (a shortened version of) my\nflake:</p>\n<div class=\"sourceCode\" id=\"cb1\"><pre\nclass=\"sourceCode nix\"><code class=\"sourceCode nix\"><span id=\"cb1-1\"><a href=\"#cb1-1\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a><span class=\"op\">{</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb1-2\"><a href=\"#cb1-2\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>  <span class=\"va\">description</span> <span class=\"op\">=</span> <span class=\"st\">\"some description\"</span><span class=\"op\">;</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb1-3\"><a href=\"#cb1-3\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>  <span class=\"va\">inputs</span> <span class=\"op\">=</span> <span class=\"op\">{</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb1-4\"><a href=\"#cb1-4\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>    <span class=\"co\"># ... nixpkgs, other inputs...</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb1-5\"><a href=\"#cb1-5\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a></span>\n<span id=\"cb1-6\"><a href=\"#cb1-6\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>    <span class=\"va\">home-manager</span> <span class=\"op\">=</span> <span class=\"op\">{</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb1-7\"><a href=\"#cb1-7\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>      <span class=\"va\">url</span> <span class=\"op\">=</span> <span class=\"st\">\"github:nix-community/home-manager/release-24.05\"</span><span class=\"op\">;</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb1-8\"><a href=\"#cb1-8\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>      <span class=\"va\">inputs</span>.<span class=\"va\">nixpkgs</span>.<span class=\"va\">follows</span> <span class=\"op\">=</span> <span class=\"st\">\"nixpkgs\"</span><span class=\"op\">;</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb1-9\"><a href=\"#cb1-9\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>    <span class=\"op\">};</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb1-10\"><a href=\"#cb1-10\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>  <span class=\"op\">};</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb1-11\"><a href=\"#cb1-11\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a></span>\n<span id=\"cb1-12\"><a href=\"#cb1-12\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>  <span class=\"va\">outputs</span> <span class=\"op\">=</span> <span class=\"op\">{</span> <span class=\"va\">nixpkgs</span><span class=\"op\">,</span> <span class=\"op\">...</span> <span class=\"op\">}</span>: <span class=\"op\">{</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb1-13\"><a href=\"#cb1-13\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>    <span class=\"va\">nixosConfigurations</span> <span class=\"op\">=</span> <span class=\"op\">{</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb1-14\"><a href=\"#cb1-14\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>      <span class=\"va\">HOSTNAME</span> <span class=\"op\">=</span> nixpkgs<span class=\"op\">.</span>lib<span class=\"op\">.</span>nixosSystem <span class=\"op\">{</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb1-15\"><a href=\"#cb1-15\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>        <span class=\"va\">modules</span> <span class=\"op\">=</span> <span class=\"op\">[</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb1-16\"><a href=\"#cb1-16\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>          <span class=\"ss\">./host/HOSTNAME</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb1-17\"><a href=\"#cb1-17\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>          hm<span class=\"op\">.</span>nixosModules<span class=\"op\">.</span>home-manager</span>\n<span id=\"cb1-18\"><a href=\"#cb1-18\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a></span>\n<span id=\"cb1-19\"><a href=\"#cb1-19\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>          <span class=\"op\">{</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb1-20\"><a href=\"#cb1-20\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>            <span class=\"va\">home-manager</span> <span class=\"op\">=</span> <span class=\"op\">{</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb1-21\"><a href=\"#cb1-21\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>              <span class=\"co\"># ...

This, too, I don’t like very much,\nbecause it doesn’t feel like a very “nix” way of solving things. I will\nconcede that this is the simplest solution, and should cover most cases\nas well.</p>\n<h2 data-number=\"2\" id=\"taking-advantage-of-flakes\"><span\nclass=\"header-section-number\">2</span> Taking advantage of flakes</h2>\n<p>The next two solutions take advantage of flakes to detach packages\nand their configurations from the entire nixos system configuration\n(and, consequently, home manager as well). This does mean we won’t have\naccess to all the niceties and options provided by home manager, but in\nmy experience it’s not been a very big loss.</p>\n<p>Now, if you’re as unfamiliar with flakes as I was before writing this\npost, you’ll want to know a bit about flakes and how they work. A lot of\npeople describe flakes as just “a bunch of inputs and outputs”, which is\ntrue, but grossly unhelpful. I’ll try to give what is hopefully a more\nuseful answer. Flakes indeed take just about anything as an input -\nsource code, configuration files, or (most commonly) other flakes. It\ncan then produce a number of different types of outputs, with some of\nthe most common being:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>NixOS configurations: you already saw this in the example above. A\nNixOS configuration tells nix how to build the nixos system;</li>\n<li>Dev shells;</li>\n<li>Packages.</li>\n</ul>\n<note>\nRead more about <a\nhref=\"https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/other-usage-of-flakes/outputs\">flake\noutputs here</a>.\n</note>\n<p>Each of these outputs has a nix CLI command associated with it that\nallows us to consume that output. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>nixos-rebuild switch --flake <path/to/flake>#<hostname></code>\nto use a nixos configuration output;</li>\n<li><code>nix develop <path/to/flake>#<devshell></code> to\nenter a dev shell;</li>\n<li><code>nix run <path/to/flake>#<pkg-name></code> to build\nand run a package.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We’re interested in that last one. We’ll take the original package,\nsomehow bundle our configuration together with it, and then use\n<code>nix run <flake>#<pkg></code> to build just that\npackage (along with our configuration) and run it. This cleanly avoids\nhaving to rebuild the system, while still making sure our configuration\nis handled by nix.</p>\n<h3 data-number=\"2.1\" id=\"overriding-the-package\"><span\nclass=\"header-section-number\">2.1</span> Overriding the package</h3>\n<p>We can modify nix packages by overriding the arguments passed to them\nor their attributes, using <code><pkg>.override</code> or\n<code><pkg>.overrideAttrs</code> respectively. A lot of packages\nwill take extra configuration as an argument, and we can override them.\nSometimes this is enough to achieve what we want. Neovim is one such\npackage, so we’ll try it out.</p>\n<p>Let’s start by adding an output to the flake:</p>\n<div class=\"sourceCode\" id=\"cb4\"><pre\nclass=\"sourceCode nix\"><code class=\"sourceCode nix\"><span id=\"cb4-1\"><a href=\"#cb4-1\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a><span class=\"co\"># In flake.nix...</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb4-2\"><a href=\"#cb4-2\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a><span class=\"op\">{</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb4-3\"><a href=\"#cb4-3\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>  <span class=\"co\"># ...
