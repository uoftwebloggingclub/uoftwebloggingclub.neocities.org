        "excerpt": "Iâ€™ve decided to archive a few of these because of the ethereal nature of these projects, with websites going down and file uploads getting removed, and the occasional nuke-everything-and-run by the admins. Many of these zines are uploaded in the most bizarre places, such as itch.io and Mega, which makes it impossible for the Wayback Machine to properly archive."

        "title": "Monthly WHWC Challenge #1: Small Web",
        "excerpt": "SW is all about decentralizing the web to promote creativity, individuality, and ownership. However, ironically, to achieve that we need a centralized discovery platform and an accessible, massive website creation tool. If we really want to replace social media and be main stream, I don't see another way. \n\nOr maybe, the small web is created by the big web to sell more web?"

        "excerpt": "What we've lost in its stead is the feeling of a interconnected internet. No more do we have to enter webrings or webtaxis and hop through several links to find the page we want. No more saving links to a text file on your harddrive. For the most part, there is no journey or effort to get to where we want!"
