title: May Event Wrap-up + Announcements
---
Welcome to our over-halfway-done June update!

<br>

To get started, our May event concluded with... 0 submissions? (It's summer, so surely we're too busy frolicking in a meadow to touch our dusty old laptops right!?). We're extending the deadline for both May and the following topic to the end of July to allow more ample time, so please submit at your own leisure.  

<br>

Also: announcing our June-July event topic - [Video](/events/june2025)!  

<br>

As you may have noticed on [calendar](/cal), we'll be at [HTML in the Park](https://html.green/) at Dovercourt Park, Toronto. Please join us there!

Thats all!
