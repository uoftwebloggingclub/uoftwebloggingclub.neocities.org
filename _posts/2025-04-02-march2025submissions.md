title: March Writing Event Conclusion + April Announcement
---

With a little extra time for late submissions, our first monthly writing event has concluded!

Thank you to whoever who participated! You may browse the submissions on the [event page](/events/march2025).

We are also announcing our April 2025 Theme:
### Nostalgia!

April, as the start of spring, is a month of reflection and new beginnings. As you look back at the past from the present, write a blog post on the feeling of nostalgia.Though you are not required to answer all or any of these, the following list of questions can help you get started:

- What triggers your nostalgia?
- Describe a childhood memory…
- What is a movie or TV show that you’re nostalgic for?
- Is nostalgia a negative or positive emotion?
- Does nostalgia distort the past?

Event page will be up later on in the month.
