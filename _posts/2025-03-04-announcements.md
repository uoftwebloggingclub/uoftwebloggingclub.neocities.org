title: 3 announcements!
---

We have 3 things to share this time!

Firstly, the announcement feed link has been changed from ```/announcements.atom``` to [```/announcements.xml```](/announcements.xml) to maintain consistency! Please update your readers!

Secondly, we have finalized dates for Office hours for the rest of the term! Please see the dates and location below!

Finally, **please fill out the [member registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScB0yKqaSncRt0Mg0OyW7d5vwjtPIUfMoS4CO5_LuxUtRktEg/viewform) if you havent already**. Yes, you should still do this even if you registered by email since we have to collect more information than before to qualify for UTSU funding. Sorry for the inconvenience!
